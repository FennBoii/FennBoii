<h3>About me</h3>
Hey, Im Nate, Called FennBoii online. I do things here and there. Im not that cool but I do things, again, here and there.
<!-- V1. Hey, I'm FennBoii but I usually go by Fennec and my real name is 'Nathan'. I'm all over the place but I don't bite so if you want me to do anything for you just ask and I'll try my best to help you! I do a lot of hobby stuff and projects on the side involving unity and nodejs mostly. I'm open to talk about anything and open to meeting new people and talking infront if them, i'll be prepared and presentable. -->
<!-- V0. Hey, I'm FennBoii but I usually go by Fennec and my real name is 'Nathan'. I'm all over the place but I don't bite so if you want me to do anything for you just ask and I'll try my best to help you! I honestly dont have a lot of connections so that makes me some kind of loner without a lover, im also ***Asexual***, Im open to talk about anything though and open to meeting new people and talking infront if them, i wont be scared. -->

<!-- <h2>Im Invested</h2> -->
<!-- V1. I currently am working towards a proper job and some kind if computer science career. I'm not only working towards two ceritfications, i'm interested in different programming languages as well which I do as a hobby; These include python, Javascript(both for webdev and nodejs), and a little more than the basics of C#! I work on unity projects and have a bit of experience with the engine and all of it's workarounds. I also've got the handle of blender recently so I've been messing with it and I think I've got the handle enough to make something awesome! -->
<!-- V0. I currently am working towards a proper job and some kind if computer science future!
I'm not only working towards my ceritfications, i'm interested in different programming languages as my hobby; These include python, Javascript(both for webdev and nodejs), html, css, and a little more than the basics of C#.. I know a few more but i wont add them because im not a even a beginner in them. I love to learn new things and i also have **learning binary** on my bucket list so ill get to that eventually. -->

<h3>Im busy</h3>
I have quite a bit of projects going for me, mostly because of my inconsistency in different subjects. I dont really do things right but I try to keep trying.
<!-- V1. I can be very creative at times and present very interesting ideas, I've got quite a few projects Im currently working on as well, specifically for vrchat. I've also got some other projects that aren't realted to game engines at all and that I just do in my free time but those aren't that important. I've got a ton of ideas, some interesting, some uncanny but I've got quite the endless projects I can work on but I don't have quite have the time I'd like to so maybe I can work for someone who's got a REAL idea for a project and maybe  I can help it become something BIG! -->
<!-- V0. I've got quite a list of ideas i can share if you do reach out about a few different things. You can suggest a topic and ill bring an idea on the table in less than a minute, it'll probably already have been created but if given enough time, ill present to you something inspiring. (top a week)
Im not afraid to ask for help, ill quickly ask got help if my list of processes are unable to fix the problem. Why? Its because if you don't ask fir help, youll waste company time. -->

<h3>Lastly, Im Weird</h3>
When have you ever met someone who LIKES to be alone? when has anyone you know stoped existing correctly? Exactly, everyone. Im just an ordinary one in the ocean of ordinary..
<!-- V1. I do currently have a STRONG position working at pavillions currently but I plan to leave, to start my career journey and find my place. I've got quite a bit of experience in some areas and I plan to utilize them at my fullest! I've got a lot of projects I'd like to work on but anything you need, I'm right there with you.
I don't have a really tight schedule, it's more-so packed with duties but I'm ready to pursue my future at full speed. -->
<!--V0. I do already have a job working in a **deli at a pavillions** but i'm looking to leave and pursue **literally any** position available even if it isn't a paid position just so i can build my knowledge of how these 1s and 0s work. -->


<h3>Thanks for reading</h3>
Thanks for glancing.. I dont know. Love or hate me, Ill take it. Gooday to you stranger <\3
<!-- V1. Thanks for reading this little **about me**, I've got a lot to work on but I'm always learning, always improving.

I hope you have a lovely day, **thank you**. *You can reach me on discord with the tag 'fennboii' I'm overlyfriendy and I don't bite.* -->
<!-- V0. This was a little about me, ive got quite a passion for computer science and everything within it. Im learning everyday willingly and ive probably touched a little bit of every part of the spectrum of the **computer science** field.

<h5>Anyway, Thanks for talking the time to read this and i hope you have a good **morning**.</h5> -->
