    #About me
Hey, I'm FennBoii but I usually go by Fennec and my real name is 'Nathan'.
I'm all over the place but I don't bite so if you want me to do anything for you just ask and I'll try my best to help you!
- I honestly dont have a lot of connections so that makes me some kind of loner without a lover, im also ***Asexual*** with a cold heart, you should keep that im mind (DONT DATE ME ILL LEAVE YOU NUMB, COLD, AND CONFUSED)
- Im open to talk about anything though and open to meeting new people and talking infront if them, i wont be scared.

[Im Invested]
<h2>I currently am working towards a proper job and some kind if computer science future</h2>
- I'm not only working towards my ceritfications, i'm interested in different programming languages as my hobby; These include python, Javascript(both for webdev and nodejs), html, css, and a little more than the basics of C#.. I know a feq more but i wont add them because im not a pro in them.
- I love to learn new things and i also have **learning binary** on my bucket list so ill get to that eventually.

[Im creative]
- I've got quite a list if ideas i can share if you do reach out about a few different things. You can suggest a topic and ill bring an idea on the table in less than a minute, it'll probably already have been created but if given enough time, ill present to you something inspiring. (top a week)
- Im not afraid to ask for help, ill quickly ask got help if my list of processes are unable to fix the problem. Why? Its because if you don't ask fir help, youll waste company time.

[Lastly, Im Free]
- I do already have a job working in a **deli at a pavillions** but i'm looking to leave and pursue **literally any** position available even if it isn't a paid position just so i can build my knowledge of how these 1s and 0s work.


<h1>Thanks for reading</h1>
-This was a little about me, ive got quite a passion for computer science and everything within it. Im learning everyday willingly and ive probably touched a little bit of every part of the spectrum of the **computer science** field.

#Thanks for talking the time to read this and i hope you have a goid **morning**.
